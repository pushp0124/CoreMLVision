## CoreMLVision

## Project Description

Recognise Image Picked by User using CoreML and Vision. 

CoreML: Core ML lets you integrate a broad variety of machine learning model types into your app.Because itâ€™s built on top of low level technologies like Metal and Accelerate, Core ML seamlessly takes advantage of the CPU and GPU to provide maximum performance and efficiency. We can run machine learning models on the device so data doesn't need to leave the device to be analyzed. Thus it does everything for us.

Vision: We can easily build computer vision machine learning features into our app using the framework.

GoogleNetPlaces: It detects the scene of an image from 205 categories such as an airport terminal, bedroom, forest, coast, and more.
